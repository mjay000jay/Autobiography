        <h2>Early life</h2>
        
            <p> I was born on August 24, 2003 in Cebu City, a place that Iâ€™ve always called home, to loving and strict parents Concepcion and Edito Montebon. I still have my two grandmothers each from both sides of my parents. I am the second daughter among the first 3 daughters in our family, we were called back then the 'Tres Marias' wherever we go. But it all stopped after 6 years when my two brothers were born.</p>
        <p> Growing up, I was surrounded with my cousins, mostly, and would spent countless hours playing with them. We played some games like 'tagu-taguan', luksong tinik, patintero, PS-PS, Bahaw-bahaw, langit lupa, and etc. But my favorite was handkerchief snatch game and bahaw-bahaw/home is my favorite because I always outsmart them.
        
            <p> My childhood is not always great. I grew up to a household that is not vocal about their feelings. So I learned to keep my feelings to myself. And an incident happened where my parents had a huge fight that led them to be separated. My father stayed in our house and my mom went away. My two sisters and I, temporarily stayed with my aunt's house so that there's someone who will take care of us while my mom took my two younger brothers with her.
            People thought we were too young to understand the situation, we know what's going on but we kept it to ourselves. My sister has a bubbly personality and she was able to relief herself with her friends. But I was the opposite, I had a hard time coping with the situation that I almost didn't take my exams. Fortunately, I was able to pass my exams and even got myself to the Special Science Class. 
            When my mom heard the news, she decided to fix their situation that lead to their reconciliation. I was not sad about them separating, I was sad because I was so close with my brothers and I thought I would never see them again. But I was happy that they were back together.

            I went to Talamban Elementary School during my kindergarten and my primary school years. In my junior and senior high school, I went to Talamban National High School. Currently, I am an undergrad student in Cebu Technological University taking the program of Bachelor of Science in Information Systems.
            I was a late bloomer when it comes to academics and slow when it comes to everything. So my mom thought I wasn't going to be an SSC student after kindergarten but after the exams and interiew, I was able to pass the entrance exam and got myself into the Special Science Class. I wasn't able to get to top 10 but was consistent to be in top 15. During highschool, I was a consistent honor student. Most of my teachers back then recognized my writings but I was not that confident to join any writing competitions.
            I was also a member of a church choir during highschool but had to stop after two months due to school works. This time, I also get to see my special person, my first crush. He was my classmate and he's good in math. 
            Fast forward to my college years, I met a new set of friends but one of them that I got close with named Ann Gella Barrios. With her, I got to see a different side of me because she always saved me from an awkward social interactions.
