        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy exploring crafts, music, and movies. Iâ€™m a fan of K-pop, especially groups like Got7 and Seventeen. I also love creating handmade crafts and watching movies to relax and escape into different worlds.
            I play Soduko mostly at home. I am a curious person after all, so I love doing random stuff, only stuffs that are safe. I tried to crochet but I don't have the materials to finish it. I love to read books, mostly fiction and romance.
            I also like to surf internet for fun facts. Lastly, I seldom draw, too.</p>

        <h2>Dreams and Aspirations</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">My ultimate goal is to achieve success and financial stability. Someday, I want to chase the dreams I once made an option due to practicality in life. I dream to travel the world and experience different cultures. I want to explore the beauty of nature and meet new people along the way.
             I also aspire to be a successful entrepreneur, running my own business that aligns with my passions and values.
             I dream of building a happy and fulfilling career while continuing to grow as a person and enjoying the journey ahead.</p>
